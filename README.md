# Frontend_collaborative-canvas
A multi-user drawing web application built using HTML5 Canvas, Vanilla JavaScript, and Node.js (WebSockets) that allows multiple users to draw together in real time. Each user can select brush tools, colors, and stroke widths, while seeing others’ live drawings and cursor movements.  The project demonstrates real-time synchronization.
